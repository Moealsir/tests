# Simple Shell Project

This project is a simple shell implementation divided into several files to handle different string operations, string manipulation, and linked list management. The shell provides basic functionality found in command-line interfaces.

## How to Compile

To compile the project, execute the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

This assumes that all your `.c` files are in the same directory.<br>
## Usage Examples

### Running the Shell

Once compiled, run the shell using:
```bash
./hsh
```


### Available Commands

The shell provides the following functionalities:

- **String Operations:** Includes string comparison, copying, concatenation, and more.
- **String Parsing:** Allows the splitting of strings into words.
- **Linked List Management:** Involves adding, printing, deleting, and freeing nodes.
